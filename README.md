# cezar-16

supports a few basic instructions

has its own assembly compiler

run emulator with cargo run

run assembler with cargo run --bin assembler filename.asm

# how it runs
cpu runs over the program and uses the ram as memory, unlike irl computers it doesnt fetch and execute ram instructions. ram is purely for data
